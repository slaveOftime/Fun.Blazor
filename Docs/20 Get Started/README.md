# Get Started

## Please check the samples for a quick start

- Document site source code: https://github.com/slaveOftime/Fun.Blazor/tree/master/Fun.Blazor.Docs.Wasm. 

- Templates, also with more samples in it: https://github.com/slaveOftime/Fun.Blazor.Samples.

## Use dotnet templates:

[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Fun.Blazor.Templates)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fun.Blazor.Templates) ðŸ‘ˆ always try to use the latest one.

```shell
dotnet new --install Fun.Blazor.Templates::4.1.1
# We have multiple templates to get you started, you can run this to check
dotnet new list --tag Fun.Blazor
# You can try the simplest one:
dotnet new fun-wasm -o FunBlazorDemo1
```

## Code structure example (just my opinionated way)

> If you prefer blazor csharp official style, you can just use fun-blazor template to get started.

This project supports multiple patterns for state management. From my experience, it is not good to use Elmish for your whole project because of the performance and state share concern. Sometimes, it is a little verbose.  

You can try this:

**Db**  
**Domain**  
**Services**  
**UI**  
|--- Stores.fs // contains shared store or global store

```fsharp
type IShareStore with // scoped for the session in blazor server mode
    member store.IsDark = store.CreateCVal("IsDark", true)

type IGlobalStore with // Singleton store, shared for all. Used in server-side blazor to share some data for all connected users.
    ...
```

|--- Hooks.fs // standalone UI logic

```fsharp
type IComponentHook with
    member hook.TryLoadPosts(page) = task {
        ...
    }

    member hook.UseSettingsForm() =
        hook
           .UseAdaptiveForm({| Name = "foo"; ... |})
           .AddValidators(...)
           .AddValidators(...)
```

|--- Controls.fs // Some small shared controls  
|--- Comp1.fs // Your business component  

```fsharp
// Make your fragment smaller, so you can compose it in a cleaner way and get better inline optimization, hot-reload speeding, and intellisense performance
let private fragment1 = div {...}

let private fragment2 (shareStore: IShareStore) =
    adaptiview {
        let! isDark, setIsDark = shareStore.IsDark.WithSetter()
        div { ... } 
    }

// Or use Elmish if you like
let private fragment3 = html.elmish (init, update, view)

type Comp1 =
    // So we can provide overloads for future iteration
    static member Create() =
        html.inject (fun (svc1, shareStore: IShareStore, ...) ->
            div {
                fragment1
                fragment2 shareStore
                fragment3
            }
        )
```

|--- Comp2.Hooks.fs // in case you have a large component, or you can even create a separate folder for the whole component  
|--- Comp2.Control1.fs // manage a large control which is only for your business Comp2  
|--- Comp2.fs // The entry for your comp2  
|--- App.fs // compose your components or pages

```fsharp
let private routes =
    html.route [
        routeCi "/page1" (Comp1.Create())
        routeAny (Comp2.Create())
    ]

let app =
    div {
        header
        routes
        footer
    }
```

|--- Index.fs // if you are using blazor server mode, you need to have this. You can check the template.  
|--- Startup.fs
